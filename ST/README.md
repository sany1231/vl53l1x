This directory contains a manual conversion of the ST driver to Javascript.

While the code seems to provide measurement results- it is overly complex 
and is hard to tune/debug.

The exported API for this node module does NOT rely on any of this code. 

It is provided here in hope that it may be helpful to someone. In it's current
form, it should not be considered complete, accurate, or production ready.
